    "liner": "Oratorio Virtuale is an electroacoustic rework of the baroque oratorio San Giovanni Battista composed in 1675 by Alessandro Stradella. An A/V experience of strong emotional impact, that explodes as an act of rebellion of ancestral and proto-human forces. Ineluctable natural forces, always capable of renewal, overcoming even the hyper-technology domination of our times.",
