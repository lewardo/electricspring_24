    "liner": "The projects Tesla and <a href='https://hervebirolini.com/portfolios-items/des-eclairs/'>Des Éclairs</a> are the beginning of a cycle of reflection and works around the question of energy. Des Éclairs is about using not only speakers, but also the sonic power of the electric arc. Electric charges, shocks, fluxes, deflagrations, Plasma speakers, Ruhmkorff coils and Tesla coils, are different and complementary devices to enable us to see and hear electric matter in movement.",

From concert pieces to installations, from electroacoustic performances to incidental music for films and drama, from radiophonic art to mixed music, his different experimentations enrich each other and constantly question his role as a composer."
